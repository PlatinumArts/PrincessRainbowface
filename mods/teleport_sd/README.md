Minetest Teleport-SD Mod
==========

One or more source teleporters can be configured with the coordinates of a destination teleporter.
Standing on and punching the source teleporter loads the destination area,
checks for a destination teleporter with same owner as the source teleporter or no owner,
checks for two air blocks above destination teleporter
and then teleports the player.
