# cityscape
City landscape for Minetest

This mod makes rudimentary roads and buildings. It's more of an experiment than anything, but might be fun for someone to play with. It could be terrain for zombie attack games or just blowing things up.

Roads and city terrain are located by perlin noise. Natural terrain is left alone everywhere else. Cityscape only works with the new "valleys" mapgen at the moment, because the road noise has to match the terrain. It may be possible to accomodate other mapgens in the future.
