Code for machine based off of Noncubic by yves_de_beck

mysiding adds lines to the front of the block. All other sides stay the same.

Simply craft the machine. Open the machine and put your blocks in. Click either wide or narrow and take your blocks.
When the blocks are placed the side with the lines will face you.
